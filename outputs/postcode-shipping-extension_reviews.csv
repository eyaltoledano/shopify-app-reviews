My Event Decor,5,"January 21, 2020",The Postcode Shipping Extension is worth six stars! The support you get from Zann is the best of any app I've ever used and he is a delight to work with. He explained I didn't need the Australia Post app which saved me money and walked me through how to set up the postcodes. This has paid for itself already as customers get to choose either the free pickup-instore option or the fee for their city or regional area. I wish I had added this years ago.

Party Things Canada,1,"May 5, 2021","I cannot provide information on how the App works, because I was unable to get pass the shipping zones configuration. Customer service was impossible, because although they respond fast, I had no less than 3 people answering my one question. Each had a different version of what the App can and can not do, and each one had a different interpretation of my question. If you wish to have the App showing rates AFTER a minimum cart amount has been reached, you still have to come up with a defined rate (not carrier rates, which is my preference) to add to their field in order to be able to continue the set up. Ramon, Carlos, Santiago and Jerome seemed to believe I was asking for the App to block or modify the carrier live rates when clearly, I'm asking for the opposite, which is NOT TO have to input a field (orders under $50) where I want only live rates to be the ones show to customers. I felt I was on a hidden camera show where people respond totally the opposite every time to see how you react.... still scratching my head.",Canada,4 days using the app

I was able to set it up in less than half an hour and had it replicated in all of my stores. There aren´t enough stars to rate this amazing app! It even works in kilos and with my currency, which seems something small to be grateful about, but it has been something I haven´t found in all the Shipping apps I tried.

Venom Skateboards,5,"February 11, 2022","If you are a UK based seller and use a mixture of shipping services like Royal Mail & DPD, then you'll likely need to charge different rates for certain Postcode areas as the Carriers charge you different rates (i.e sending to Scottish Highlands). Shopify won't let you do this unless you are on Plus which is too pricey for most of us. Thankfully this awesome app allows you to set up tricky postcode shipping rules for the UK and further afield, the setup and interface are easy to use and the results are spot on.
